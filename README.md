## App info 

based on the design - https://www.figma.com/file/fKLXCi65Tr37t47xq6vUcU/Brainwave.io---Landing-Page-UI-Kit---Saas-Landing-Page---Creative-App-Landing-Page-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-3346&mode=design&t=iTC8l4JO40zDKd0c-0

I have created this page as close to the figma design I have made the page responsive also. due to the 1 hour time constraint I have not been able to fix spacing everywhere on the page and include a border top line at the bottom of the page. 



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
